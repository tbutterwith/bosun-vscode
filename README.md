## OpenTSDB Metric Path Completion

### Configuration

The settings for OpenTSDB metric path completion are configured per workspace, allowing you to have a different OpenTSDB set up for each bosun project. The following configuration parameters are available:

```js
{
    "bosun": {
        "openTsdb": {
            "url": "<the url of your OpenTSDB api>", // should be included without the protocol
            "port": 4242 // the port your OpenTSDB api is accessible on - default 4242
            "maxEntries": 500 // the number of metrics paths to fetch in the request - default 500
        }
    }
}
```

## FAQ

### Changing the associated file extension

By default, files with a `.conf` extention are registered as bosun files. To mark a single file as a bosun file, use the language indicator or the language selection drop down using `âŒ˜K M`. For more information see the vscode [guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/overview#_changing-the-language-for-the-selected-file).

To add more file extensions or replace the defaults add the follow snippet the user settings. For more information see the vscode [guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/overview#_adding-a-file-extension-to-a-language).

```json
"files.associations": {
        "*.conf": "bosun"
    }
```

### Autocompletion does not show all my metric paths

This could be caused by not returning enough paths from the `suggest` API. Try increasing the `maxEntries` setting.
